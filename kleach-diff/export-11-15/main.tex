\begin{abstract}
Electronic Health Records (EHR) containing a massive number of patient diagnosis records have been used to predict patients' future or potential diseases according to their past diagnoses.
While many data mining tools have been adopted for EHR-based disease early detection, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is one of the most commonly used statistical methods.
However, it is difficult to train an accurate LDA model to detect specific diseases early when too few patients are known to have the target disease and the EHR data are manually coded with noise.  In such cases, the covariance matrices used in LDA are usually singular and estimated with a large variance.
 
This paper presents \TheName{}, an extending LDA framework using Electronic Health Records, to address these issues.
Beyond existing LDA analyzers, we propose \TheName{} to 1) eliminate the data noise caused by the manual encoding of EHR data, and 2) lower the decision risk of LDA modeld with finely-estimated parameters when only a few patients' EHR are given for training.
To achieve these two goals, we designed an iterative algorithm to improve the covariance matrix estimation with embedded data-noise/decision-risk reduction for LDA.
We evaluated \TheName{} extensively using a large-scale real-world EHR dataset, CHSN.
Specifically, our experiments compared the performance of LDA to three baselines (i.e., LDA and its derivatives) in terms of identifying college students at high risk for mental health disorders from 23 US universities.
Experimental results show \TheName{} significantly outperforms the three baselines by achieving 1.4\%--19.4\% higher accuracy, and a 7.5\%--43.5\% higher F1-score.
