	abstract = {With the rapid development of information technologies, tremendous amount of data became readily available in various application domains. This big data era presents challenges to many conventional data analytics research directions including data capture, storage, search, sharing, analysis, and visualization. It is no surprise to see that the success of next-generation healthcare systems heavily relies on the effective utilization of gigantic amounts of medical data. The ability of analyzing big data in modern healthcare systems plays a vital role in the improvement of the quality of care delivery. Specifically, patient similarity evaluation aims at estimating the clinical affinity and diagnostic proximity of patients. As one of the successful data driven techniques adopted in healthcare systems, patient similarity evaluation plays a fundamental role in many healthcare research areas such as prognosis, risk assessment, and comparative effectiveness analysis. However, existing algorithms for patient similarity evaluation are inefficient in handling massive patient data. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Semi-Supervised Recursive Tree Partitioning (ART) framework for large scale patient indexing such that the patients with similar clinical or diagnostic patterns can be correctly and efficiently retrieved. The framework is designed for semi-supervised settings since it is crucial to leverage experts' supervision knowledge in medical scenario, which are fairly limited compared to the available data. Starting from the proposed ART framework, we will discuss several specific instantiations and validate them on both benchmark and real world healthcare data. Our results show that with the ART framework, the patients can be efficiently and effectively indexed in the sense that (1) similarity patients can be retrieved in a very short time; (2) the retrieval performance can beat the state-of-the art indexing methods.},

	abstract = {Patients’ medical conditions often evolve in complex and seemingly unpredictable ways. Even within a relatively narrow and well-defined episode of care, variations between patients in both their progression and eventual outcome can be dramatic. Understanding the patterns of events observed within a population that most correlate with differences in outcome is therefore an important task in many types of studies using retrospective electronic health data. In this paper, we present a method for interactive pattern mining and analysis that supports ad hoc visual exploration of patterns mined from retrospective clinical patient data. Our approach combines (1) visual query capabilities to interactively specify episode definitions, (2) pattern mining techniques to help discover important intermediate events within an episode, and (3) interactive visualization techniques that help uncover event patterns that most impact outcome and how those associations change over time. In addition to presenting our methodology, we describe a prototype implementation and present use cases highlighting the types of insights or hypotheses that our approach can help uncover.},

	abstract = {Comprehensive risk assessment lies in the core of enabling proactive healthcare delivery systems. In recent years, data-driven predictive modeling approaches have been increasingly recognized as promising techniques to help enhance healthcare quality and reduce cost. In this paper, we propose a data-driven comprehensive risk prediction method, named LINKAGE, which can be used to jointly assess a set of associated risks in support of holistic care management. Our method can not only perform prediction but also discover the relationships among those risks. The advantages of the proposed model include: 1) It can leverage the relationship between risks and domains and achieve better risk prediction performance; 2) It provides a data-driven approach to understand relationship between risks; 3) It leverages the information between risk prediction and risk association learning to regulate the improvement on both parts; 4) It provides flexibility to incorporate domain knowledge in learning risk associations. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed model on synthetic data and a real-world healthcare survey data set.},

	abstract = {Objective
In order to derive data-driven insights, we develop Care Pathway Explorer, a system that mines and visualizes a set of frequent event sequences from patient EMR data. The goal is to utilize historical EMR data to extract common sequences of medical events such as diagnoses and treatments, and investigate how these sequences correlate with patient outcome.
Materials and methods
The Care Pathway Explorer uses a frequent sequence mining algorithm adapted to handle the real-world properties of EMR data, including techniques for handling event concurrency, multiple levels-of-detail, temporal context, and outcome. The mined patterns are then visualized in an interactive user interface consisting of novel overview and flow visualizations.
Results
We use the proposed system to analyze the diagnoses and treatments of a cohort of hyperlipidemic patients with hypertension and diabetes pre-conditions, and demonstrate the clinical relevance of patterns mined from EMR data. The patterns that were identified corresponded to clinical and published knowledge, some of it unknown to the physician at the time of discovery.
Conclusion
Care Pathway Explorer, which combines frequent sequence mining techniques with advanced visualizations supports the integration of data-driven insights into care pathway discovery.},

Compared to global models trained on all patients, they have the potential to produce more accurate risk scores and capture more relevant risk factors for individual patients. This paper presents an approach for building personalized predictive models and generating personalized risk factor profiles. A locally supervised metric learning (LSML) similarity measure is trained for diabetes onset and used to find clinically similar patients. Personalized risk profiles are created by analyzing the parameters of the trained personalized logistic regression models. A 15,000 patient data set, derived from electronic health records, is used to evaluate the approach. The predictive results show that the personalized models can outperform the global model. Cluster analysis of the risk profiles show groups of patients with similar risk factors, differences in the top risk factors for different groups of patients and differences between the individual and global risk factors.},

At the core, patient similarity takes an index patient as the input and retrieves a ranked list of similar patients that are relevant in a specific clinical context. It takes patient information such as their electronic health records as input and computes the distance between a pair of patients based on those information. To construct a clinically valid similarity measure, physician input often needs to be incorporated. However, obtaining physicians' input is difficult and expensive. As a result, typically only limited physician feedbacks can be obtained on a small portion of patients. How to leverage all unlabeled patient data and limited supervision information from physicians to construct a clinically meaningful distance metric? In this paper, we present a patient similarity framework (PSF) that unifies and significantly extends existing supervised patient similarity metric learning methods. PSF is a general framework that can learn an appropriate distance metric through supervised and unsupervised information. Within PSF framework, we propose a novel patient similarity algorithm that uses local spline regression to capture the unsupervised information. To speedup the incorporation of physician feedback or newly available clinical information, we introduce a general online update algorithm for an existing PSF distance metric.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth in the development of healthcare information systems has led to an increased interest in utilizing the patient Electronic Health Records (EHR) for assisting disease diagnosis and phenotyping. The patient EHRs are generally longitudinal and naturally represented as medical event sequences, where the events include clinical notes, problems, medications, vital signs, laboratory reports, etc. The longitudinal and heterogeneous properties make EHR analysis an inherently difficult challenge. To address this challenge, in this paper, we develop a novel representation, namely the temporal graph, for such event sequences. The temporal graph is informative for a variety of challenging analytic tasks, such as predictive modeling, since it can capture temporal relationships of the medical events in each event sequence. By summarizing the longitudinal data, the temporal graphs are also robust and resistant to noisy and irregular observations. Based on the temporal graph representation, we further develop an approach for temporal phenotyping to identify the most significant and interpretable graph basis as phenotypes. This helps us better understand the disease evolving patterns. Moreover, by expressing the temporal graphs with the phenotypes, the expressing coefficients can be used for applications such as personalized medicine, disease diagnosis, and patient segmentation. Our temporal phenotyping framework is also flexible to incorporate semi-supervised/supervised information. Finally, we validate our framework on two real-world tasks. One is predicting the onset risk of heart failure. Another is predicting the risk of heart failure related hospitalization for patients with COPD pre-condition. Our results show that the diagnosis performance in both tasks can be improved significantly by the proposed approaches. Also, we illustrate some interesting phenotypes derived from the data.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Depression is a prevalent disorder difficult to diagnose and treat. In particular, depressed patients exhibit largely unpredictable responses to treatment. Toward the goal of personalizing treatment for depression, we develop and evaluate computational models that use electronic health record (EHR) data for predicting the diagnosis and severity of depression, and response to treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We develop regression-based models for predicting depression, its severity, and response to treatment from EHR data, using structured diagnosis and medication codes as well as free-text clinical reports. We used two datasets: 35,000 patients (5000 depressed) from the Palo Alto Medical Foundation and 5651 patients treated for depression from the Group Health Research Institute.
RESULTS: Our models are able to predict a future diagnosis of depression up to 12 months in advance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.70-0.80). We can differentiate patients with severe baseline depression from those with minimal or mild baseline depression (AUC 0.72). Baseline depression severity was the strongest predictor of treatment response for medication and psychotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to use EHR data to predict a diagnosis of depression up to 12 months in advance and to differentiate between extreme baseline levels of depression. The models use commonly available data on diagnosis, medication, and clinical progress notes, making them easily portable. The ability to automatically determine severity can facilitate assembly of large patient cohorts with similar severity from multiple sites, which may enable elucidation of the moderators of treatment response in the future.},

	abstract = {This research studies the risk prediction of hospital readmissions using metaheuristic and data mining approaches. This is a critical issue in the U.S. healthcare system because a large percentage of preventable hospital readmissions derive from a low quality of care during patients’ stays in the hospital as well as poor arrangement of the discharge process. To reduce the number of hospital readmissions, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has launched a readmission penalty program in which hospitals receive reduced reimbursement for high readmission rates for Medicare beneficiaries. In the current practice, patient readmission risk is widely assessed by evaluating a LACE score including length of stay (L), acuity level of admission (A), comorbidity condition (C), and use of emergency rooms (E). However, the LACE threshold classifying high- and low-risk readmitted patients is set up by clinic practitioners based on specific circumstances and experiences. This research proposed various data mining approaches to identify the risk group of a particular patient, including neural network model, random forest (RF) algorithm, and the hybrid model of swarm intelligence heuristic and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed neural network algorithm, the RF and the SVM classifiers are used to model patients’ characteristics, such as their ages, insurance payers, medication risks, etc. Experiments are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed models with previous research. Experimental results indicate that the proposed prediction SVM model with particle swarm parameter tuning outperforms other algorithms and achieves 78.4\% on overall prediction accuracy, 97.3\% on sensitivity. The high sensitivity shows its strength in correctly identifying readmitted patients. The outcome of this research will help reduce overall hospital readmission rates and allow hospitals to utilize their resources more efficiently to enhance interventions for high-risk patients.},

Data mining can uncover new biomedical and healthcare knowledge for clinical and administrative decision making as well as generate scientific hypotheses from large experimental data, clinical databases, and/or biomedical literature. This review first introduces data mining in general (e.g., the background, definition, and process of data mining), discusses the major differences between statistics and data mining and then speaks to the uniqueness of data mining in the biomedical and healthcare fields. A brief summarization of various data mining algorithms used for classification, clustering, and association as well as their respective advantages and drawbacks is also presented. Suggested guidelines on how to use data mining algorithms in each area of classification, clustering, and association are offered along with three examples of how data mining has been used in the healthcare industry. Given the successful application of data mining by health related organizations that has helped to predict health insurance fraud and under-diagnosed patients, and identify and classify at-risk people in terms of health with the goal of reducing healthcare cost, we introduce how data mining technologies (in each area of classification, clustering, and association) have been used for a multitude of purposes, including research in the biomedical and healthcare fields. A discussion of the technologies available to enable the prediction of healthcare costs (including length of hospital stay), disease diagnosis and prognosis, and the discovery of hidden biomedical and healthcare patterns from related databases is offered along with a discussion of the use of data mining to discover such relationships as those between health conditions and a disease, relationships among diseases, and relationships among drugs.

PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three universities representing approximately 730,000 enrolled students contributed data from January 1, 2011 through May 31, 2014.
METHODS: Participating schools uploaded de-identified electronic health records from student health services monthly.
RESULTS: During this study, just over 800,000 individuals used the health centers, comprising 4.17M patient encounters. Sixty percent of visits included primary care, 13\% mental health, 9\% vaccination, and 31\% other miscellaneous services. The five most common specific diagnostic categories (with annual rates per 100 enrolled students) were preventive (16); respiratory (12); skin, hair and nails; infectious non-STI (5 each); and mental health (4). Utilization and epidemiologic trends are identified among subpopulations of students.
CONCLUSIONS: CHSN data establishes trends in utilization and epidemiologic patterns by college students and the importance of primary and behavioral health care services on campuses.},

In medical domains, attempts to apply the complete CBR cycle are rather exceptional.

So, in this paper we discuss the appropriateness of CBR for medical knowledge-based systems, point out problems, limitations and possibilities how they can partly be overcome.},

The first part reviews the existing methods for measuring similarity in the literature based on more than 100 CBR project studies and some general similarity measures seen in other applications .

	issn = {0169-2607},
	abstract = {Adverse drug events (ADEs) are a major limitation of drug safety. They are often caused by inappropriate selection of dose and the concurrent use of drugs modulating each other (drug interaction). Risk assessment and prevention strategies must therefore consider co-administered drugs, individual doses, and their timing. In a new approach we evaluated the performance of cross correlation, commonly used in signal processing, to determine similarities in patient treatments. To achieve this, patient treatments were modeled as groups of vectors representing discrete time intervals. These vectors were cross-correlated and the results evaluated to find clusters in time courses indicating similarity in treatment of different patients.

To evaluate our algorithm, we then created a number of test cases. The focus of this article is on each treatment, and its pattern in time and dosage. The algorithm successfully produces a relatively low similarity score for cases that are completely different with respect to their pattern of time and dosage but high scores when they are equal (score of 0.699) or similar (score of 0.528) in their therapies, and thus succeeds in having a relatively high specificity (27/30). Such an approach might help to considerably reduce the problem of false alarms which hampers most existing alerting systems for medication errors or impending ADEs.},

	abstract = {Sequence classification has a broad range of applications such as genomic analysis, information retrieval, health informatics, finance, and abnormal detection. Different from the classification task on feature vectors, sequences do not have explicit features. Even with sophisticated feature selection techniques, the dimensionality of potential features may still be very high and the sequential nature of features is difficult to capture. This makes sequence classification a more challenging task than classification on feature vectors. In this paper, we present a brief review of the existing work on sequence classification. We summarize the sequence classification in terms of methodologies and application domains. We also provide a review on several extensions of the sequence classification problem, such as early classification on sequences and semi-supervised learning on sequences.},

In this article, we show how six existing domain-independent measures can be adapted to the biomedical domain. These measures were originally based on WordNet, an English lexical database of concepts and relations. In this research, we adapt these measures to the SNOMED-CT® ontology of medical concepts. The measures include two path-based measures, and three measures that augment path-based measures with information content statistics from corpora. We also derive a context vector measure based on medical corpora that can be used as a measure of semantic relatedness. These six measures are evaluated against a newly created test bed of 30 medical concept pairs scored by three physicians and nine medical coders. We find that the medical coders and physicians differ in their ratings, and that the context vector measure correlates most closely with the physicians, while the path-based measures and one of the information content measures correlates most closely with the medical coders. We conclude that there is a role both for more flexible measures of relatedness based on information derived from corpora, as well as for measures that rely on existing ontological structures.},

	In addition, the likelihood that breast cancer risk is due to specific

	determined. Recent developments have reinforced the clinical importance
	of breast cancer risk assessment. Tamoxifen chemoprevention as well
	as prevention studies such as the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene
	are available to women at increased risk of developing breast cancer.
	In addition, specific management strategies are now defined for BRCA1
	and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Risk may be assessed as the likelihood
	of developing breast cancer (using risk assessment models) or as
	the likelihood of detecting a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (using prior
	probability models). Each of the models has advantages and disadvantages,
	and all need to be interpreted in context. We review available risk
	assessment tools and discuss their application. As illustrated by
	clinical examples, optimal counseling may require the use of several
	models, as well as clinical judgment, to provide the most accurate

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE��Interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes should be directed
	toward individuals at increased risk for the disease. To identify

	Risk Score.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS��A random population sample
	of 35- to 64-year-old men and women with no antidiabetic drug treatment
	at baseline were followed for 10 years. New cases of drug-treated
	type 2 diabetes were ascertained from the National Drug Registry.
	Multivariate logistic regression model coefficients were used to
	assign each variable category a score. The Diabetes Risk Score was
	composed as the sum of these individual scores. The validity of the
	score was tested in an independent population survey performed in
	1992 with prospective follow-up for 5 years.RESULTS��Age, BMI, waist
	circumference, history of antihypertensive drug treatment and high
	blood glucose, physical activity, and daily consumption of fruits,
	berries, or vegetables were selected as categorical variables. Complete
	baseline risk data were found in 4,435 subjects with 182 incident
	cases of diabetes. The Diabetes Risk Score value varied from 0 to
	20. To predict drug-treated diabetes, the score value ��9 had sensitivity
	of 0.78 and 0.81, specificity of 0.77 and 0.76, and positive predictive
	value of 0.13 and 0.05 in the 1987 and 1992 cohorts, respectively.CONCLUSIONS��The
	Diabetes Risk Score is a simple, fast, inexpensive, noninvasive,
	and reliable tool to identify individuals at high risk for type 2

The measures include two path-based measures, and three measures that augment path-based measures with information content statistics from corpora. We also derive a context vector measure based on medical corpora that can be used as a measure of semantic relatedness. These six measures are evaluated against a newly created test bed of 30 medical concept pairs scored by three physicians and nine medical coders. We find that the medical coders and physicians differ in their ratings, and that the context vector measure correlates most closely with the physicians, while the path-based measures and one of the information content measures correlates most closely with the medical coders. We conclude that there is a role both for more flexible measures of relatedness based on information derived from corpora, as well as for measures that rely on existing ontological structures.},

Instead of recognizing the disorder and exploring psychosocial contributors to illness, nonpsychiatric physicians tend to repeatedly pursue organic possibilities through multiple tests, procedures, medications, and operations. In patients with somatization disorders, the dollar costs of this strategy are only exceeded by its potential for iatrogenic harm. More productive treatment strategies are presented, emphasizing the need for a long-term relationship with a primary care provider who will treat the patient and his symptoms seriously and respectfully but who is not compelled to invasively evaluate all symptoms.({JAMA} 1985;254:3075-3079)},

This paper provides data on the incidence and persistence of current somatization syndrome in a large cross-national sample drawn from 15 sites in 14 countries.Methods. After screening with the General Health Questionnaire, a stratified sample of 5438 primary care patients was interviewed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and evaluated for physical health status, self-rated overall health and for occupational disability. Twelve months later, 3204 of the patients completed follow-up interviews.Results. Over a 12-month period, an abridged form of somatization defined as four current symptoms in males and six in females was persistent in 45·9\% of the patients. Persistence of syndrome was related to age and to subjective indices of psychological distress at baseline. Persistence was unrelated to depression. The 12-month incidence of the abridged somatization syndrome was 7·1\% (95\% {CI}, 6·1–8·3\%). Individuals with depression at baseline and those with poor view of their health were more likely to develop new episodes of somatization 12-months later.Conclusion. Somatization syndrome showed considerable change over time. Persistence and onset of somatization were related to both level of psychopathology and health beliefs.},

	abstract = {Mental disorders are among the strongest predictors of suicide attempts. However, little is known regarding which disorders that are uniquely associated with suicidal behavior because of high levels of psychiatric comorbidity. We examined the unique associations between individual disorders and subsequent suicidal behavior (suicide ideation, plans and attempts) using data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, a nationally representative household survey of 9282 {US} adults. Results revealed that approximately 80\% of suicide attempters in the United States have a temporally prior mental disorder. Anxiety, mood, impulse-control and substance use disorders all significantly predict subsequent suicide attempts in bivariate analyses (odds ratios ({OR})=2.7–6.7); however, these associations decrease substantially in multivariate analyses controlling for comorbidity ({OR}=1.5–2.3) but remain statistically significant in most cases. Disaggregation of the observed effects reveals that depression predicts suicide ideation, but not suicide plans or attempts among those with ideation. Instead, disorders characterized by severe anxiety/agitation (for example, post-traumatic stress disorder) and poor impulse control (for example, conduct disorder, substance use disorders) predict which suicide ideators who go on to make a plan or attempt. These results advance understanding of the unique associations between mental disorders and different forms of suicidal behavior. Future research must further delineate the mechanisms through which people come to think about suicide and progress from suicidal thoughts to attempts.},

	abstract = {Analyzing sequence data has become increasingly important recently in the area of biological sequences, text documents, Web access logs, etc. We investigate the problem of clustering sequences based on their sequential features. As a widely recognized technique, clustering has proven to be very useful in detecting unknown object categories and revealing hidden correlations among objects. One difficulty that prevents clustering from being performed extensively on sequence data (in categorical domain) is the lack of an effective yet efficient similarity measure. Therefore, we propose a novel model (CLUSEQ) for sequence cluster by exploring significant statistical properties possessed by the sequences. The conditional probability distribution (CPD) of the next symbol given a preceding segment is derived and used to characterize sequence behavior and to support the similarity measure. A variation of the suffix tree, namely probabilistic suffix tree, is employed to organize (the significant portion of) the CPD in a concise way. A novel algorithm is devised to efficiently discover clusters with high quality and is able to automatically adjust the number of clusters to its optimal range via a unique combination of successive new cluster generation and cluster consolidation. The performance of CLUSEQ has been demonstrated via extensive experiments on several real and synthetic sequence databases.},

	abstract = {Discovering contrasts between collections of data is an important task in data mining. In this paper, we introduce a new type of contrast pattern, called a Minimal Distinguishing Subsequence (MDS). An MDS is a minimal subsequence that occurs frequently in one class of sequences and infrequently in sequences of another class. It is a natural way of representing strong and succinct contrast information between two sequential datasets and can be useful in applications such as protein comparison, document comparison and building sequential classification models. Mining MDS patterns is a challenging task and is significantly different from mining contrasts between relational/transactional data. One particularly important type of constraint that can be integrated into the mining process is the gap constraint. We present an efficient algorithm called ConSGapMiner (Contrast Sequences with Gap Miner), to mine all MDSs satisfying a minimum and maximum gap constraint, plus a maximum length constraint. It employs highly efficient bitset and boolean operations, for powerful gap-based pruning within a prefix growth framework. A performance evaluation with both sparse and dense datasets, demonstrates the scalability of ConSGapMiner and shows its ability to mine patterns from high dimensional datasets at low supports.},

This paper introduces the density concept into distinguishing sequential pattern mining, extending previous studies which considered gap and support constraints. Density is concerned with the number of times of given patterns occur in individual sequences; it is an important factor in many applications including biology, healthcare and financial analysis. We present gd-DSPMiner, a mining method with various pruning techniques, for mining density-aware distinguishing sequential patterns that satisfy density and gap, as well as support, constraints. With respect to computational speed, when the procedures related to density are masked gd-DSPMiner is substantially faster than previous distinguishing sequential pattern mining methods. Experiments on real data sets confirmed the effectiveness and efficiency of gd-DSPMiner in the general setting and the ability of gd-DSPMiner to discover density-aware distinguishing sequential patterns.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors examined the effect of patients' style of clinical presentation on primary care physicians' recognition of depression and anxiety.
METHOD: The subjects were 685 patients attending family medicine clinics on self-initiated visits. They completed structured interviews assessing presenting complaints, self-report measures of symptoms and hypochondriacal worry, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Physician recognition was determined by notation of any psychiatric condition in the medical chart over the ensuing 12 months.
RESULTS: The authors identified three progressively more persistent forms of somatic presentations, labeled "initial," "facultative," and "true" somatization. Of 215 patients with CES-D scores of 16 or higher, 80\% made somatized presentations; of 75 patients with DIS-diagnosed major depression or anxiety disorder, 76\% made somatic presentations. Among patients with DIS major depression or anxiety disorder, somatization reduced physician recognition from 77\%, for psychosocial presenters, to 22\%, for true somatizers. The same pattern was found for patients with high CES-D scores. In logistic regression models education, seriousness of concurrent medical illness, hypochondriacal worry, and number of lifetime medically unexplained symptoms each increased the likelihood of recognition, while somatized presentations decreased the rate of recognition.
CONCLUSIONS: While physician recognition of psychiatric distress in primary care varied widely with different criteria for recognition, the same pattern of reduction of recognition with increasing level of somatization was found for all criteria. In contrast, hypochondriacal worry and medically unexplained somatic symptoms increased the rate of recognition.},

To determine diagnostic overlap of depression, anxiety and somatization as well as their unique and overlapping contribution to functional impairment.
Method
Two thousand ninety-one consecutive primary care clinic patients participated in a multicenter cross-sectional survey in 15 primary care clinics in the United States (participation rate, 92\%). Depression, anxiety, somatization and functional impairment were assessed using validated scales from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) (PHQ-8, eight-item depression module; GAD-7, seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale; and PHQ-15, 15-item somatic symptom scale) and the Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-20). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to investigate unique and overlapping associations of depression, anxiety and somatization with functional impairment.
Results
In over 50\% of cases, comorbidities existed between depression, anxiety and somatization. The contribution of the commonalities of depression, anxiety and somatization to functional impairment substantially exceeded the contribution of their independent parts. Nevertheless, depression, anxiety and somatization did have important and individual effects (i.e., separate from their overlap effect) on certain areas of functional impairment.
Conclusions
Given the large syndrome overlap, a potential consideration for future diagnostic classification would be to describe basic diagnostic criteria for a single overarching disorder and to optionally code additional diagnostic features that allow a more detailed classification into specific depressive, anxiety and somatoform subtypes.},

	abstract = {Background
Painful and non-painful somatic symptoms are often reported in patients with depressive disorder. The proper identification of depression-relevant somatic symptoms is important for the accurate diagnosis of depression, development of treatment strategies and measurement of outcome. The objective of this study was to characterize the relationship between somatic symptoms and depression in patients diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), using data from randomized drug trials carried out by a pharmaceutical company.
Methods
Pooled ‘blinded’ data from 2191 patients enrolled in randomized, multicenter, double-blind placebo-controlled studies for the treatment of MDD were analyzed. Somatic symptoms were assessed using the Somatic Symptoms Inventory (SSI) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was used to assess symptoms of depression.
Results
The most common somatic symptom reported by patients with MDD was ‘feeling fatigued, weak, or tired all over’, with 78\% of patients reporting ‘moderate’ levels or above. This was followed by ‘feeling that not in as good physical health as most of your friends’ (59\%), ‘not feeling well most of the time in the past few years’ (54\%), and ‘feeling weak in parts of body’ (45\%). ‘Headache’ was the most common pain-related symptom with 43\% reporting ‘moderate’ or above. Pearson's product-moment correlations revealed that somatic symptoms generally increased as a function of overall depressive (r = 0.43), with ‘feeling fatigued, weak, or tired all over’ (r = 0.50), ‘feeling that not in as good physical health as most of your friends’ (r = 0.42), ‘feeling weak in parts of body’ (r = 0.41), ‘heavy feeling in arms and legs’ (r = 0.34), ‘not feeling well most of the time in the past few years’ (r = 0.32), and ‘headache’ (r = 0.31) showing the strongest correlation with overall HAMD scores. Non-parametric item response analyses showed that many somatic symptoms demonstrate good relationship between item response and the overall severity of depression. In particular, ‘feeling fatigued, weak, or tired all over’ exhibited good discriminative properties across the full range of severity for depression.
Limitations
The analysis utilized data from a ‘restricted’ patient population in drug trials sponsored by a pharmaceutical company.
Conclusions
These results demonstrate a high prevalence and association of somatic symptoms in patients with MDD, including feelings of fatigue, physical malaise and pain-related symptoms, which could be potentially useful in the assessment of depression and in the evaluation of treatment strategies.},

Painful physical symptoms (PPS) are frequent in patients with Major Depressive Episode (MDE). Here, the 12-month prevalence and sociodemographic characteristics of PPS were examined taking into account somatic comorbidity; quantitative and qualitative aspects of MDE with or without PPS were investigated as well as their impact on work loss days (WLD). Finally, help seeking and delay in help seeking were explored.
Methods
In a cross-sectional, population-based study, a representative random sample of non-institutionalised adults from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain (N = 21,425) was interviewed using the World Mental Health Composite Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0 of the WHO).
Results
PPS were reported by 29\% of respondents without MDE and by 50\% in those with MDE. Female gender, higher age and lower educational level were predictive of PPS. PPS were more frequent in more severely depressed patients but no qualitative differences were found in MDE with and MDE without PPS. An additive effect of MDE and PPS was found on the WLD score. Whether a comorbid somatic disorder was present or not did not change the findings. Finally, respondents with MDE and PPS had lower rates of help seeking for emotional reasons and show a trend to delay their help seeking longer.
Limitations
The most important limitation of this study was its reliance on self-report data about somatic disorders.
Conclusion
Approximately one in two persons with a mood disorder also reported the presence of PPS. MDE and PPS result in decreased productivity and in lower rates of help seeking.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pain syndrome is thought to play a role in depression. This study assesses the prevalence of chronic ({\textgreater}or= 6 months' duration) painful physical conditions (CPPCs) (joint/articular, limb, or back pain, headaches, or gastrointestinal diseases) and their relationship with major depressive disorder.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional telephone survey of a random sample of 18 980 subjects from 15 to 100 years old representative of the general populations of the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Answers provided during telephone interviews using the Sleep-EVAL system were the main outcome measure. Interviews included questions about mental disorders and medical conditions. Data on painful physical conditions were obtained through questions about medical treatment, consultations, and/or hospitalizations for medical conditions and a list of 42 diseases.
RESULTS: Of all subjects interviewed, 17.1\% reported having at least 1 CPPC (95\% confidence interval [CI], 16.5\%-17.6\%). At least 1 depressive symptom (sadness, depression, hopelessness, loss of interest, or lack of pleasure) was present in 16.5\% of subjects (95\% CI, 16.0\%-17.1\%); 27.6\% of these subjects had at least 1 CPPC. Major depressive disorder was diagnosed in 4.0\% of subjects; 43.4\% of these subjects had at least 1 CPPC, which was 4 times more often than in subjects without major depressive disorder (odds ratio [OR], 4.0; 95\% CI, 3.5-4.7). In a logistic regression model, CPPC was strongly associated with major depressive disorder (OR: CPPC alone, 3.6; CPPC + nonpainful medical condition, 5.2); 24-hour presence of pain made an independent contribution to major depressive disorder diagnosis (OR, 1.6).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CPPCs increases the duration of depressive mood. Patients seeking consultation for a CPPC should be systematically evaluated for depression.},

BalanceCascade trains the learners sequentially, where in each step, the majority class examples that are correctly classified by the current trained learners are removed from further consideration. Experimental results show that both methods have higher Area Under the ROC Curve, F-measure, and G-mean values than many existing class-imbalance learning methods.

	abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of ``normal'' examples with only a small percentage of ``abnormal'' or ``interesting'' examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer starts as a local disease, but it can metastasize to the lymph nodes and distant organs. At primary diagnosis, prognostic markers are used to assess whether the transition to systemic disease is likely to have occurred. The prevailing model of metastasis reflects this view — it suggests that metastatic capacity is a late, acquired event in tumorigenesis. Others have proposed the idea that breast cancer is intrinsically a systemic disease. New molecular technologies, such as DNA microarrays, support the idea that metastatic capacity might be an inherent feature of breast tumours. These data have important implications for prognosis predicition and our understanding of metastasis.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.eswa.2015.04.066},
	abstract = {This research studies the risk prediction of hospital readmissions using metaheuristic and data mining approaches. This is a critical issue in the U.S. healthcare system because a large percentage of preventable hospital readmissions derive from a low quality of care during patients’ stays in the hospital as well as poor arrangement of the discharge process. To reduce the number of hospital readmissions, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has launched a readmission penalty program in which hospitals receive reduced reimbursement for high readmission rates for Medicare beneficiaries. In the current practice, patient readmission risk is widely assessed by evaluating a LACE score including length of stay (L), acuity level of admission (A), comorbidity condition (C), and use of emergency rooms (E). However, the LACE threshold classifying high- and low-risk readmitted patients is set up by clinic practitioners based on specific circumstances and experiences. This research proposed various data mining approaches to identify the risk group of a particular patient, including neural network model, random forest (RF) algorithm, and the hybrid model of swarm intelligence heuristic and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed neural network algorithm, the RF and the SVM classifiers are used to model patients’ characteristics, such as their ages, insurance payers, medication risks, etc. Experiments are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed models with previous research. Experimental results indicate that the proposed prediction SVM model with particle swarm parameter tuning outperforms other algorithms and achieves 78.4\% on overall prediction accuracy, 97.3\% on sensitivity. The high sensitivity shows its strength in correctly identifying readmitted patients. The outcome of this research will help reduce overall hospital readmission rates and allow hospitals to utilize their resources more efficiently to enhance interventions for high-risk patients.},

	doi = {10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002733},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Depression is a prevalent disorder difficult to diagnose and treat. In particular, depressed patients exhibit largely unpredictable responses to treatment. Toward the goal of personalizing treatment for depression, we develop and evaluate computational models that use electronic health record (EHR) data for predicting the diagnosis and severity of depression, and response to treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We develop regression-based models for predicting depression, its severity, and response to treatment from EHR data, using structured diagnosis and medication codes as well as free-text clinical reports. We used two datasets: 35,000 patients (5000 depressed) from the Palo Alto Medical Foundation and 5651 patients treated for depression from the Group Health Research Institute.
RESULTS: Our models are able to predict a future diagnosis of depression up to 12 months in advance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.70-0.80). We can differentiate patients with severe baseline depression from those with minimal or mild baseline depression (AUC 0.72). Baseline depression severity was the strongest predictor of treatment response for medication and psychotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to use EHR data to predict a diagnosis of depression up to 12 months in advance and to differentiate between extreme baseline levels of depression. The models use commonly available data on diagnosis, medication, and clinical progress notes, making them easily portable. The ability to automatically determine severity can facilitate assembly of large patient cohorts with similar severity from multiple sites, which may enable elucidation of the moderators of treatment response in the future.},

	abstract = {As a new concept that emerged in the middle of 1990’s, data mining can help researchers gain both novel and deep insights and can facilitate unprecedented understanding of large biomedical datasets. Data mining can uncover new biomedical and healthcare knowledge for clinical and administrative decision making as well as generate scientific hypotheses from large experimental data, clinical databases, and/or biomedical literature. This review first introduces data mining in general (e.g., the background, definition, and process of data mining), discusses the major differences between statistics and data mining and then speaks to the uniqueness of data mining in the biomedical and healthcare fields. A brief summarization of various data mining algorithms used for classification, clustering, and association as well as their respective advantages and drawbacks is also presented. Suggested guidelines on how to use data mining algorithms in each area of classification, clustering, and association are offered along with three examples of how data mining has been used in the healthcare industry. Given the successful application of data mining by health related organizations that has helped to predict health insurance fraud and under-diagnosed patients, and identify and classify at-risk people in terms of health with the goal of reducing healthcare cost, we introduce how data mining technologies (in each area of classification, clustering, and association) have been used for a multitude of purposes, including research in the biomedical and healthcare fields. A discussion of the technologies available to enable the prediction of healthcare costs (including length of hospital stay), disease diagnosis and prognosis, and the discovery of hidden biomedical and healthcare patterns from related databases is offered along with a discussion of the use of data mining to discover such relationships as those between health conditions and a disease, relationships among diseases, and relationships among drugs. The article concludes with a discussion of the problems that hamper the clinical use of data mining by health professionals.},
