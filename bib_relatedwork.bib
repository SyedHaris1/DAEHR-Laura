	abstract = {With the rapid development of information technologies, tremendous amount of data became readily available in various application domains. This big data era presents challenges to many conventional data analytics research directions including data capture, storage, search, sharing, analysis, and visualization. It is no surprise to see that the success of next-generation healthcare systems heavily relies on the effective utilization of gigantic amounts of medical data. The ability of analyzing big data in modern healthcare systems plays a vital role in the improvement of the quality of care delivery. Specifically, patient similarity evaluation aims at estimating the clinical affinity and diagnostic proximity of patients. As one of the successful data driven techniques adopted in healthcare systems, patient similarity evaluation plays a fundamental role in many healthcare research areas such as prognosis, risk assessment, and comparative effectiveness analysis. However, existing algorithms for patient similarity evaluation are inefficient in handling massive patient data. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Semi-Supervised Recursive Tree Partitioning (ART) framework for large scale patient indexing such that the patients with similar clinical or diagnostic patterns can be correctly and efficiently retrieved. The framework is designed for semi-supervised settings since it is crucial to leverage experts' supervision knowledge in medical scenario, which are fairly limited compared to the available data. Starting from the proposed ART framework, we will discuss several specific instantiations and validate them on both benchmark and real world healthcare data. Our results show that with the ART framework, the patients can be efficiently and effectively indexed in the sense that (1) similarity patients can be retrieved in a very short time; (2) the retrieval performance can beat the state-of-the art indexing methods.},

	abstract = {Patientsâ€™ medical conditions often evolve in complex and seemingly unpredictable ways. Even within a relatively narrow and well-defined episode of care, variations between patients in both their progression and eventual outcome can be dramatic. Understanding the patterns of events observed within a population that most correlate with differences in outcome is therefore an important task in many types of studies using retrospective electronic health data. In this paper, we present a method for interactive pattern mining and analysis that supports ad hoc visual exploration of patterns mined from retrospective clinical patient data. Our approach combines (1) visual query capabilities to interactively specify episode definitions, (2) pattern mining techniques to help discover important intermediate events within an episode, and (3) interactive visualization techniques that help uncover event patterns that most impact outcome and how those associations change over time. In addition to presenting our methodology, we describe a prototype implementation and present use cases highlighting the types of insights or hypotheses that our approach can help uncover.},

In this paper, we propose a data-driven comprehensive risk prediction method, named LINKAGE, which can be used to jointly assess a set of associated risks in support of holistic care management. Our method can not only perform prediction but also discover the relationships among those risks. The advantages of the proposed model include: 1) It can leverage the relationship between risks and domains and achieve better risk prediction performance; 2) It provides a data-driven approach to understand relationship between risks; 3) It leverages the information between risk prediction and risk association learning to regulate the improvement on both parts; 4) It provides flexibility to incorporate domain knowledge in learning risk associations. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed model on synthetic data and a real-world healthcare survey data set.},

	abstract = {Objective
In order to derive data-driven insights, we develop Care Pathway Explorer, a system that mines and visualizes a set of frequent event sequences from patient EMR data. The goal is to utilize historical EMR data to extract common sequences of medical events such as diagnoses and treatments, and investigate how these sequences correlate with patient outcome.
Materials and methods
The Care Pathway Explorer uses a frequent sequence mining algorithm adapted to handle the real-world properties of EMR data, including techniques for handling event concurrency, multiple levels-of-detail, temporal context, and outcome. The mined patterns are then visualized in an interactive user interface consisting of novel overview and flow visualizations.
Results
We use the proposed system to analyze the diagnoses and treatments of a cohort of hyperlipidemic patients with hypertension and diabetes pre-conditions, and demonstrate the clinical relevance of patterns mined from EMR data. The patterns that were identified corresponded to clinical and published knowledge, some of it unknown to the physician at the time of discovery.
Conclusion
Care Pathway Explorer, which combines frequent sequence mining techniques with advanced visualizations supports the integration of data-driven insights into care pathway discovery.},

Compared to global models trained on all patients, they have the potential to produce more accurate risk scores and capture more relevant risk factors for individual patients. This paper presents an approach for building personalized predictive models and generating personalized risk factor profiles. A locally supervised metric learning (LSML) similarity measure is trained for diabetes onset and used to find clinically similar patients. Personalized risk profiles are created by analyzing the parameters of the trained personalized logistic regression models. A 15,000 patient data set, derived from electronic health records, is used to evaluate the approach. The predictive results show that the personalized models can outperform the global model. Cluster analysis of the risk profiles show groups of patients with similar risk factors, differences in the top risk factors for different groups of patients and differences between the individual and global risk factors.},

At the core, patient similarity takes an index patient as the input and retrieves a ranked list of similar patients that are relevant in a specific clinical context. It takes patient information such as their electronic health records as input and computes the distance between a pair of patients based on those information. To construct a clinically valid similarity measure, physician input often needs to be incorporated. However, obtaining physicians' input is difficult and expensive. As a result, typically only limited physician feedbacks can be obtained on a small portion of patients. How to leverage all unlabeled patient data and limited supervision information from physicians to construct a clinically meaningful distance metric? In this paper, we present a patient similarity framework (PSF) that unifies and significantly extends existing supervised patient similarity metric learning methods. PSF is a general framework that can learn an appropriate distance metric through supervised and unsupervised information. Within PSF framework, we propose a novel patient similarity algorithm that uses local spline regression to capture the unsupervised information. To speedup the incorporation of physician feedback or newly available clinical information, we introduce a general online update algorithm for an existing PSF distance metric.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth in the development of healthcare information systems has led to an increased interest in utilizing the patient Electronic Health Records (EHR) for assisting disease diagnosis and phenotyping. The patient EHRs are generally longitudinal and naturally represented as medical event sequences, where the events include clinical notes, problems, medications, vital signs, laboratory reports, etc. The longitudinal and heterogeneous properties make EHR analysis an inherently difficult challenge. To address this challenge, in this paper, we develop a novel representation, namely the temporal graph, for such event sequences. The temporal graph is informative for a variety of challenging analytic tasks, such as predictive modeling, since it can capture temporal relationships of the medical events in each event sequence. By summarizing the longitudinal data, the temporal graphs are also robust and resistant to noisy and irregular observations. Based on the temporal graph representation, we further develop an approach for temporal phenotyping to identify the most significant and interpretable graph basis as phenotypes. This helps us better understand the disease evolving patterns. Moreover, by expressing the temporal graphs with the phenotypes, the expressing coefficients can be used for applications such as personalized medicine, disease diagnosis, and patient segmentation. Our temporal phenotyping framework is also flexible to incorporate semi-supervised/supervised information. Finally, we validate our framework on two real-world tasks. One is predicting the onset risk of heart failure. Another is predicting the risk of heart failure related hospitalization for patients with COPD pre-condition. Our results show that the diagnosis performance in both tasks can be improved significantly by the proposed approaches. Also, we illustrate some interesting phenotypes derived from the data.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Depression is a prevalent disorder difficult to diagnose and treat. In particular, depressed patients exhibit largely unpredictable responses to treatment. Toward the goal of personalizing treatment for depression, we develop and evaluate computational models that use electronic health record (EHR) data for predicting the diagnosis and severity of depression, and response to treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We develop regression-based models for predicting depression, its severity, and response to treatment from EHR data, using structured diagnosis and medication codes as well as free-text clinical reports. We used two datasets: 35,000 patients (5000 depressed) from the Palo Alto Medical Foundation and 5651 patients treated for depression from the Group Health Research Institute.
RESULTS: Our models are able to predict a future diagnosis of depression up to 12â€…months in advance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.70-0.80). We can differentiate patients with severe baseline depression from those with minimal or mild baseline depression (AUC 0.72). Baseline depression severity was the strongest predictor of treatment response for medication and psychotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to use EHR data to predict a diagnosis of depression up to 12â€…months in advance and to differentiate between extreme baseline levels of depression. The models use commonly available data on diagnosis, medication, and clinical progress notes, making them easily portable. The ability to automatically determine severity can facilitate assembly of large patient cohorts with similar severity from multiple sites, which may enable elucidation of the moderators of treatment response in the future.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVEï¿½ï¿½Interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes should be directed
	toward individuals at increased risk for the disease. To identify
	such individuals without laboratory tests, we developed the Diabetes
	Risk Score.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSï¿½ï¿½A random population sample
	of 35- to 64-year-old men and women with no antidiabetic drug treatment
	at baseline were followed for 10 years. New cases of drug-treated
	type 2 diabetes were ascertained from the National Drug Registry.
	Multivariate logistic regression model coefficients were used to
	assign each variable category a score. The Diabetes Risk Score was
	composed as the sum of these individual scores. The validity of the
	score was tested in an independent population survey performed in
	1992 with prospective follow-up for 5 years.RESULTSï¿½ï¿½Age, BMI, waist
	circumference, history of antihypertensive drug treatment and high
	blood glucose, physical activity, and daily consumption of fruits,
	berries, or vegetables were selected as categorical variables. Complete
	baseline risk data were found in 4,435 subjects with 182 incident
	cases of diabetes. The Diabetes Risk Score value varied from 0 to
	20. To predict drug-treated diabetes, the score value ï¿½ï¿½9 had sensitivity
	of 0.78 and 0.81, specificity of 0.77 and 0.76, and positive predictive
	value of 0.13 and 0.05 in the 1987 and 1992 cohorts, respectively.CONCLUSIONSï¿½ï¿½The
	Diabetes Risk Score is a simple, fast, inexpensive, noninvasive,
	and reliable tool to identify individuals at high risk for type 2
	diabetes.}

	abstract = {This research studies the risk prediction of hospital readmissions using metaheuristic and data mining approaches. This is a critical issue in the U.S. healthcare system because a large percentage of preventable hospital readmissions derive from a low quality of care during patientsâ€™ stays in the hospital as well as poor arrangement of the discharge process. To reduce the number of hospital readmissions, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has launched a readmission penalty program in which hospitals receive reduced reimbursement for high readmission rates for Medicare beneficiaries. In the current practice, patient readmission risk is widely assessed by evaluating a LACE score including length of stay (L), acuity level of admission (A), comorbidity condition (C), and use of emergency rooms (E). However, the LACE threshold classifying high- and low-risk readmitted patients is set up by clinic practitioners based on specific circumstances and experiences. This research proposed various data mining approaches to identify the risk group of a particular patient, including neural network model, random forest (RF) algorithm, and the hybrid model of swarm intelligence heuristic and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed neural network algorithm, the RF and the SVM classifiers are used to model patientsâ€™ characteristics, such as their ages, insurance payers, medication risks, etc. Experiments are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed models with previous research. Experimental results indicate that the proposed prediction SVM model with particle swarm parameter tuning outperforms other algorithms and achieves 78.4\% on overall prediction accuracy, 97.3\% on sensitivity. The high sensitivity shows its strength in correctly identifying readmitted patients. The outcome of this research will help reduce overall hospital readmission rates and allow hospitals to utilize their resources more efficiently to enhance interventions for high-risk patients.},

	abstract = {As a new concept that emerged in the middle of 1990â€™s, data mining can help researchers gain both novel and deep insights and can facilitate unprecedented understanding of large biomedical datasets. Data mining can uncover new biomedical and healthcare knowledge for clinical and administrative decision making as well as generate scientific hypotheses from large experimental data, clinical databases, and/or biomedical literature. This review first introduces data mining in general (e.g., the background, definition, and process of data mining), discusses the major differences between statistics and data mining and then speaks to the uniqueness of data mining in the biomedical and healthcare fields. A brief summarization of various data mining algorithms used for classification, clustering, and association as well as their respective advantages and drawbacks is also presented. Suggested guidelines on how to use data mining algorithms in each area of classification, clustering, and association are offered along with three examples of how data mining has been used in the healthcare industry. Given the successful application of data mining by health related organizations that has helped to predict health insurance fraud and under-diagnosed patients, and identify and classify at-risk people in terms of health with the goal of reducing healthcare cost, we introduce how data mining technologies (in each area of classification, clustering, and association) have been used for a multitude of purposes, including research in the biomedical and healthcare fields. A discussion of the technologies available to enable the prediction of healthcare costs (including length of hospital stay), disease diagnosis and prognosis, and the discovery of hidden biomedical and healthcare patterns from related databases is offered along with a discussion of the use of data mining to discover such relationships as those between health conditions and a disease, relationships among diseases, and relationships among drugs. The article concludes with a discussion of the problems that hamper the clinical use of data mining by health professionals.},
